                <h1>How to Go Vegan TODAY</h1>
                We will break this guide into two parts: The “why” and the “how.”

                <h2>Part 1: Why You Should Be Vegan</h2>
                Having a strong reason for becoming vegan will make veganism more sustainable for you in the long run. We believe that this “why” should be centered around the animals; it is important to know what being vegan, as well as what not being vegan, means for the animals. To learn more about this, we <i>highly</i> recommend that you watch the documentary Dominion, if you haven’t already. 

                <h4>Read this before watching Dominion</h4>
                There are many popular documentaries that promote veganism or promote a plant-based diet. They are all very informative, and we encourage you to give them a watch after you’ve gone vegan. However, we feel that this documentary makes the best case for why you should become vegan, which is why we recommend that you watch it today before becoming vegan.

                Dominion is a 2 hour documentary that shows footage of <i>standard</i> practices (not isolated incidents) in the meat, dairy, and egg industries, as well as animal-based clothing industries and animal entertainment industries.

                Yes, <b>this documentary has footage of animals being abused and killed</b>. This is because producing meat, dairy, and eggs <i>requires</i> animals to be abused and killed. If you are reluctant to simply watch this type of footage because you feel that it is graphic and disturbing, that is understandable. If you so choose, you may skip watching this documentary and continue reading the rest of this article. You don’t <i>have</i> to watch this footage to be vegan. However, please read these next few paragraphs first, where we make the case for why it is important that everyone, vegans and non-vegans alike, watches this footage.

                The purpose of viewing slaughterhouse footage isn’t to guilt you or scare you into becoming vegan. The purpose is to tell the stories of these animals. It is to get you to recognize the <i>individual</i> behind your food, and to get you to empathize with them more. 

                When you walk into a supermarket, all you see is the <i>product</i>. Vacuum-sealed cuts of meat with pretty marbling. Neatly-wrapped packages of cheese. Rows of eggs in colorful cartons. Some of these products may even come with images of happy and peaceful animals living their best lives. Or labels like “free range” or “humane certified.” 

                When you watch slaughterhouse footage, you don’t see the <i>products</i> you grew up with. You see the <i>individual</i> that was kept hidden behind deceitful marketing. You see two eyes looking back at you. You see someone who is conscious and feeling. You see someone suffering and in pain. You see someone gasping for their breath as they desperately try to cling on to their lives for just a bit longer. You see someone who was alive and shared this planet with you, once upon a time. 

                Reading verbal descriptions of the footage can never be as effective as actually watching it and witnessing what the animals go through. But to be fair, even documentary footage doesn’t adequately portray what the animal experiences. It fails to convey the stench of the slaughterhouse, the mental anguish of being confined, or the sensation of a knife cutting through your throat.

                Seeing this footage helps you understand the true cost of purchasing an animal product. The cost is not paid by you; it is paid by the animal. The animal pays with their freedom, their body, their well-being, and ultimately, their life. Having to endure all of this, at the very least, these animals deserve to have their stories told. They deserve to be seen.

                <h3>After watching Dominion</h3>
                If you are reading this after watching Dominion, thank you. Bearing witness to the suffering of others can be very powerful, but can also take a toll on you. Please read this <a href="https://dominionmovement.com/self-care" target="_blank">self-care guide</a> from Dominion’s website for resources and help with processing what you’ve seen. But now that you have exposed yourself to the reality of how we treat animals, as painful as that is, you are ready to make an impact.

                If you have chosen not to watch Dominion, please take the time to read the <a href="https://dominionmovement.com/facts" target="_blank">industry practices of animal agriculture</a>, taken from Dominion’s website and complete with references. 

                Note that honey is not vegan. Consuming honey means exploiting bees for their labor and essentially stealing their food, which they worked very hard to produce. Since the honey industry is not covered in Dominion, please watch this 6-minute video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clMNw_VO1xo" target="_blank">Why don’t vegans eat honey?</a> You can also read <a href="https://earthlinged.medium.com/why-dont-vegans-eat-honey-f04a54af4f87" target="_blank">this article</a> instead, which is essentially a transcript of the aforementioned video.

                Although Dominion is centered on Australian animal agriculture, these practices are standard across the world. You cannot make an informed decision on whether or not to be vegan unless you understand what buying an animal product means for the animal.

                Animals raised for meat are slaughtered when their growth rate declines. After all, why pay to feed and house an animal when you can make more money by sending them to their death and replacing them with a more profitable animal? <a href="https://www.fourpawsusa.org/campaigns-topics/topics/farm-animals/life-expectancy" target="_blank">This infographic</a> illustrates just how young these animals are when they are sent to the kill floor.

                While most of us understand that animals are killed for meat, the same is true for animal products that we don’t normally associate with slaughter. Egg-laying hens are slaughtered when their egg production declines. Dairy cows are slaughtered when their milk production declines. Wool sheep are slaughtered when their wool becomes brittle (like what happens to our own hair as we age) and declines in quality. Male chicks are killed when they are one day old because they can’t lay eggs. Male calves are either killed when they are days old, or slaughtered after a few months for veal, because they can’t produce milk.

                Even when they are not being killed, animals are still being mistreated and exploited. Bees are often given nutritionally inadequate replacement syrup as food, because it is more profitable to sell all of their honey than it is to allow them to eat some. Dairy calves are separated from their mothers just days after birth, because it is more profitable to sell all of a cow’s milk than it is to allow their calves to drink some.

                The common theme here is that these animals are abused and exploited for profit. No matter how “well” an animal is treated while they are alive, the moment that they are no longer profitable, they are disposed of and replaced with another animal. As long as animals are viewed as commodities, the financial interests of farmers will always come before the individual interests of the animals. No animal chooses to be separated from their mother. No animal chooses to be slaughtered at a fraction of their lifespan. No animal chooses to give up their freedom and autonomy to be someone else’s property.

                This is why we implore you to become vegan today, and not gradually transition to veganism. Each and every time you consume an animal or something that comes from an animal, you are causing those animals to undergo unimaginable suffering. Take a moment and place yourself in any of these animals’ positions: would you want people to gradually stop abusing you, or would you want them to stop immediately? 

                Understand that when you become vegan, you are not merely changing your diet. Here is an example: if you are on a low-sugar diet, you might get cravings for some chocolate or cookies. You might be tempted to “cheat” on your diet a little bit. This scenario, however, is very different when applied to veganism. As a vegan, you may crave cheese, bacon, or some other animal product. It is very understandable to miss some of the foods you grew up loving. But “cheating” on a vegan diet doesn’t just mean indulging yourself; it means causing unimaginable suffering to an innocent individual. It means causing permanent harm to their lives in exchange for temporary taste pleasure.   

                Becoming vegan means making a commitment to treat animals as individuals, not as property to abuse and exploit. Most of us already see animals as someone, not something. Becoming vegan simply means that you will be living in a way that aligns with this belief you already hold. Beyond your individual choice to be vegan, you will have a real impact on the world as a whole. The fact that animals are being exploited by humans is an injustice. This unjust system exists because people support this system as individuals. Change can only happen when people decide, as individuals, to take a stand and stop supporting an injustice. Every vegan makes a difference.  

                Today, you have the opportunity to not only become vegan and stop supporting animal abuse and exploitation, but also do your part in creating a just world for all animals. Here are some practical tips that will help you make the change:

                <h2>Part 2: How to Become Vegan</h2>
                <h3>Get Used to Reading Food Labels</h3>
                If a food is labeled as “certified vegan,” then you can be pretty confident that it is vegan. If the food is not labeled vegan, you will have to read the ingredients to check. 

                Milk (and milk-derived ingredients like lactose, whey, and casein), eggs, and fish are common allergens and are usually bolded and listed separately after all of the ingredients, or are bolded and listed along with the other ingredients. Honey and gelatin are not common allergens, so you will have to comb through the ingredients section to check for them. 

                It can surely be annoying and time consuming at first, but you will get faster at this with practice! You will also grow your “database” of foods you know are vegan, so you won’t need to read the ingredients each time (although it is good practice to check every now and then, in case a company changes their recipe!).

                <h3>Recognize Which Foods You Eat Are Already Vegan</h3>
                Unless your diet consists solely of meat, dairy, and eggs, you already eat vegan foods without really thinking about it. This is great news, as it means that you don’t have to change every food that you eat! Some vegan foods you likely eat already include:

                <ul>
                    <li>Fruits and vegetables</li>
                    <li>Grains (oatmeal, bread, crackers, pasta, rice)</li>
                    <li>Nuts and legumes (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans, chickpeas)</li>
                    <li>Herbs, spices, and seasoning</li>
                    <li>“Accidentally” vegan junk food (french fries, chips, oreos, some pies, many kinds of dark chocolate) – for more:</li>
                    <ul class="indented-list">
                        <li><a href="https://vegnews.com/vegan-guides/25-accidentally-vegan-snacks-that-you-can-find-at-a-convenience-store" target="_blank">25 Accidentally Vegan Snacks You Can Find at Virtually Any Convenience Store</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://vegnews.com/products/grocery-cart-accidentally-vegan" target="_blank">18 Accidentally Vegan Grocery Store Products</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://veganuary.com/en-us/accidentally-vegan-products-usa/" target="_blank">Accidentally Vegan Products in the USA</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                Some of these foods might be nonvegan (some breads have milk or honey added to them, or some french fries, chips, and crackers have a nonvegan seasoning), but you can confirm by reading the ingredients.

                <h3>Veganize Your Go-To Foods</h3>
                This may be the most important thing you can do to help you make a very quick and convenient transition to veganism. What are your “go-to” foods? These are your meals that you rely on and find yourself coming back to again and again. It could be the breakfast bar you grab on your way to class or work every morning. Or the very simple and quick recipes you cook when you don’t have the energy to cook a more elaborate meal. Or the food that you order when you don’t have the energy to cook at all.

                Being vegan isn’t as hard as you’d think; you likely already have a routine when it comes to what you eat; there is no reason to radically change everything when you become vegan. If the breakfast bar you eat isn’t vegan, find a vegan breakfast bar instead. This goes for any grocery store item, really. If you simply look up “shopping vegan at (Kroger, Meijer, whichever store you shop at),” you will find many articles and guides on how to shop for vegan items at the grocery store. Once you do this small bit of research, you will find that shopping as a vegan takes the same amount of effort as shopping as a nonvegan (you are simply walking a couple feet over to grab a different item).

                When it comes to your go-to recipes, in most cases, there will only be a couple nonvegan ingredients. You don’t have to come up with a completely new recipe from scratch; you simply have to omit the nonvegan ingredients or replace them with vegan ingredients, and you are good to go! If you would like some ideas on how to make some of your recipes vegan, you can just look up the recipe and add the word “vegan” in your internet search (e.g. looking up “mac & cheese recipe vegan”), and you will find loads of vegan recipes to draw inspiration from. 

                <h4>Vegan Substitutions</h4>
                You can even make the substitutions yourself without using the internet. If your recipe calls for any of the animal products below, here are some possible swaps you can make:
                <ul>
                    <li>Meat: Vegan “mock” meats (vegan burgers, hot dogs, bacon, sausage, steak, crumbles, etc. Almost every type of meat has a vegan version that you can find in grocery stores), tofu, seitan, beans</li>
                    <li>Milk: Soy milk, almond milk, oat milk, coconut milk, and many other non-dairy milks</li>
                    <li>Yogurt: Almond yogurt, coconut yogurt, soy yogurt, cashew yogurt, and others</li>
                    <li>Cheese: Several brands of vegan cheese (made with cashews, coconut oil, or other ingredients), nutritional yeast (often combined with cashews)</li>
                    <li>Sour cream: Vegan sour cream alternatives, home-made tofu or cashew sour cream, non-dairy yogurt (in a pinch)</li>
                    <li>Butter: Plant-based butters, vegan margarine, oil spreads</li>
                    <li>Mayo: Several brands of vegan mayo</li>
                    <li>Eggs: tofu with black salt (“kala namak” – it has an “eggy,” “sulfury” taste), vegan egg substitute like Just Egg</li>
                    <li><a href="https://veganoutreach.org/vegan-food/" target="_blank">Vegan Swaps (Vegan Outreach)</a></li>
                </ul>
                Having even a handful of reliable vegan recipes at your disposal will make your transition so much easier! Once you start getting the hang of vegan cooking, you will be able to veganize your favorite foods and make many more recipes. You may find that, rather than being restrictive, vegan cooking actually opens the door to a variety of foods that you have never tried before. You don’t have to miss out on any flavors and textures you grew up with; as a vegan, you can still enjoy food without needlessly harming any animals in the process.

                <h4>Eating Out as a Vegan</h4>
                If you are used to ordering takeout from fast food joints or eating out at restaurants, you can almost certainly eat vegan at the same places. Most restaurants offer fully vegan options, and more and more of these options will be offered as veganism grows and the demand for vegan food grows. Even if vegan options are not offered, you can likely veganize an item by requesting that animal products be removed or replaced with something else. 

                If you look up “how to eat vegan at (insert restaurant of choice),” you will find articles that list the vegan options offered by that restaurant, written by vegans who have eaten there. Some restaurants will even list their vegan offerings on their own website or menu.

                You can also take the stress and guesswork out of eating at restaurants by supporting vegan restaurants. Columbus is home to around 20 fully-vegan restaurants. The website <a href="https://www.happycow.net/" target="_blank">Happy Cow</a> shows vegan and vegan-friendly restaurants (which offer vegan options) near your location. The website (and app) helps you find vegan options anywhere in the world, making this a great resource when traveling.

                You may find yourself in a rare situation where there are genuinely no vegan options (e.g. at a steakhouse, or at a wedding where vegan options are not offered by the catering). You can try calling the establishment ahead of time and asking if they can accommodate a vegan diet. Most places will have vegetables, rice, pasta, oil, seasoning, etc. and can easily whip up a vegan dish upon request. If even that does not work, then you will have to plan ahead and eat beforehand. 

                Being vegan doesn’t mean that you have to exclude yourself from any social situations. With a little bit of planning and preparation, you can continue living as you always have, with the main difference being that you are no longer supporting animal abuse.

                <h2>Vegan Pantry Recommendations</h2>
                Now that you have a better idea of how to “veganize” the foods you already eat, it is time to start building your vegan pantry/kitchen. Here is an example guide on how to do so:

                <a href="https://simple-veganista.com/my-kitchen-essentials/" target="_blank">Sample Vegan Pantry (The Simple Veganista)</a>

                Again, this is only an example pantry which you may use as a starting point (although you may discover some new vegan ingredients that will really come in handy or take your meals to the next level). Ideally, you would keep your pantry and kitchen items largely the same and simply switch out any non-vegan items for vegan items.

                You can still be vegan even if you have very limited space or cooking appliances. If you are living in a dorm or a hotel room, you may only have access to a mini-fridge and a microwave. Here are some products that you can buy (in addition to fruits!)

                <h3>Meal Ideas</h3>
                If you are still not sure what to eat as a vegan, here are a few ideas to get you started:

                <h3>Join a Vegan Community</h3>
                Being vegan is a lot easier when you have other vegans in your life to talk to and seek support and information from! 

                There are many online vegan groups that you can join:
                <ul>
                    <li>Search for your city’s or country’s vegan Facebook groups. You can find groups for vegans, vegan potlucks, vegan activists, etc.</li>
                    <li>Some Columbus vegan Facebook groups are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/vegan.columbus/" target="_blank">Vegan Columbus</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/341245653958278/" target="_blank">Cbus Vegan Eats</a></li>
                    <li>Vegan subreddits such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/" target="_blank">r/vegan</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndVegan/?rdt=49498" target="_blank">r/eatcheapandvegan</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/veganrecipes/" target="_blank">r/veganrecipes</a> are also great resources! Any question you may have about veganism or vegan food has likely been asked there already.</li>
                </ul>

                See if any in-person vegan meetups or socials are happening in your area:
                <ul>
                    <li>People will often post in vegan Facebook groups about potlucks or get-togethers that they are hosting</li>
                    <li>You can check <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank">Meetup</a> to see if your area has any vegan communities who meet on the regular. Here is the link to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/columbusveganmeetup/" target="_blank">Columbus Vegan Meetup</a>.</li>

                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                Hopefully, you now have everything you need to become vegan starting today: a strong moral reason centered on the animals, as well as practical tips and resources to help you make a smooth transition to veganism. 

                After becoming vegan, you will quickly notice that animal abuse is seemingly everywhere. Even after removing the obvious animal sources from your life, such as meat, dairy, eggs, honey, leather, fur, and others, you will find that animals are used in things you would never expect. Some food colorings contain animal products. Many cosmetic products are tested on animals. Even common plastics like those found in shopping bags can be nonvegan.

                This can seem very demoralizing. You might wonder if it is even possible to completely avoid animal products, or if the world will ever go vegan. 

                What should you do? We ask that you simply make the commitment to being vegan today. 

                You have learned a lot about how to be vegan, but there is still a lot that you don’t know yet at this very moment. And that’s okay. As you learn more, you will adapt your actions to this new information. Commit to stopping your support of the forms of animal abuse and exploitation that you are aware of today, and commit to stopping your support of new forms of animal abuse and exploitation when you learn about them in the future.

                <h4>Do I Make a Difference?</h4>
                Even if it seems as if you cannot make a difference as an individual, if you are against abusing and exploiting animals, then being vegan would mean that you are living in accordance with your own morals. 

                We live in a nonvegan world, where animals have been reduced to property and do not have the rights they deserve. It is currently impossible to live in our society without participating in some animal exploitation, even as a vegan. Our medical research system is set up in a way that most drugs and medicines are tested on animals. Our housing and transportation system is set up in a way that habitats are cleared and animals are displaced to make way for our roads and cities. Our agricultural subsidy system is set up in a way that a large proportion of our tax dollars is directly spent on abusing farm animals.

                But it doesn’t have to be this way. Things can change, and in fact, things already have changed. <a href="https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PETA-2021-Research-Modernization-Deal.pdf" target="_blank">Non-animal research methods</a> have been developed in an effort to phase out animal testing, with more on the way. We have the ability to rewild and reforest large areas of land that will be freed up as we slowly shift to a plant-based food system, and we have already begun to do so at a small scale. We can make this happen even faster by giving more subsidies to plant farmers instead of animal farmers, and incentivizing animal farmers to <a href="http://thetransfarmationproject.org/" target="_blank">switch to plant-based agriculture</a> so that they are not left behind. More and more people are going vegan, and companies are responding to this demand by selling more vegan products. 

                You could choose to live completely off-grid and grow your own food in isolation and avoid animal products completely. Or, you could work within the imperfect system we currently have to bring about a systemic change in the way we treat animals. 

                The second option is much more practical for most people, and although you would be taking part in some unavoidable animal exploitation for the time being, you will be playing your part in bringing about a vegan world, which would spare countless future animals from a life of suffering and servitude.

                Remember that, as a vegan, you are making a difference. While a vegan world might seem to be an impossibility right now, we are getting closer and closer to it with each person that becomes vegan. The animals are depending on people like you to lead the way.
