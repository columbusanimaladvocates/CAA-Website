                <h1>Why do we advocate for animals?</h1>
                <p>
                    We are all animals. The other animals who share the planet with us are sentient; like us, they feel pain, they feel pleasure, and they experience the world subjectively. They are individuals who matter. Despite this, a staggering number of animals are forced to endure significant cruelty and abuse. It is estimated that between 1-3 trillion animals are slaughtered each year for human consumption alone. Seeing that they cannot speak up for themselves, they rely on us to speak up and advocate on their behalf.
                </p>
                <span id="read-more-why" style="display: none;">
                    Animals, like us, are sentient individuals; we feel pleasure, we feel pain, and we experience life in our own way. For those of us who have pets or who have spent time with animals, we can say from personal experience that animals have distinct personalities; they have preferences and desires, as well as their own unique quirks. 
                    Many people consider themselves as animal lovers, and feel a deep emotional connection to other animals. Even for those who don't go so far as to claim they love animals, most are against hurting an animal for no reason. Animals matter to all of us in some way; even if they don't matter enough to you to deserve your love, they matter enough to at least not be needlessly harmed.
                    Given that animals do matter to us, it is important for us all to be aware of the fact that animals are forced to endure unimaginable cruelty and abuse. It is estimated that between 1-3 trillion animals are slaughtered each year for human consumption alone. 
                    Moreover, this statistic does not reflect the abuse that animals endure before slaughter, while they are alive. These animals endure forced confinement, forceful impregnation, bodily mutilations, mass suffocation, separation from their children, and more.
                    It's easy to get lost in the numbers, but think about that for a second: that is trillions of different individuals, each with their own unique experience of life, being abused and having their lives cut short each year.
                    Sadly, these animals cannot advocate for themselves. They are often hidden away in slaughterhouses and on farms, far from public view, where their suffering goes unnoticed. 
                    They are vulnerable and helpless, and they rely on us to speak for them. We may not know what it's exactly like to be a chicken, cow, or pig, but we share with them the capacity to suffer and the desire to have autonomy over our body. This is enough for us to be able to empathize with them. If we were in the animal's position, being abused with no way to defend ourselves, then we would desperately hope that others would come to our defense.
                    We advocate for animals because we would want someone speaking up for us if we were as vulnerable as them. We advocate for animals because they get only one life, just like we do, and they deserve to spend their limited time on Earth free from suffering and abuse.

                <p>
                    As an individual, the most effective thing you can do is become vegan. Veganism is simply the stance against abusing and exploiting animals, which most of us already agree with. Living up to this standard is much easier than you may think, and with a little bit of effort and preparation, you can become vegan today.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <a href="how-to-go-vegan-today.html">How to Go Vegan TODAY</a>
                </p>
                <span id="read-more-what" style="display: none;">
                    By going vegan, you are being true to your values by avoiding the exploitation and unnecessary suffering of animals used for food, clothing, or entertainment. You are reducing animal suffering and promoting a more compassionate world. Not only will your actions better align with your own moral compass, but you will be an example for others.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The meat, dairy, egg, honey, fur, leather, wool, silk, down, and animal entertainment industries cause tremendous suffering and death to animals. These industries ignore the individuality and value that animals have, reducing them to mere objects to buy and consume.
                    <br/><br/>
                    However, we don't have to take part in these industries. We don't have to eat or wear animals or animal products. We can be vegan instead.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Being vegan means that you treat animals as individuals worthy of moral consideration, not as property. Being vegan means that you do not abuse animals, exploit animals, or support any industries that do so.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If you see animals as a someone, not a something, if you see animals as a unique individual instead of a slab of meat, if you see animals for who they are instead of what you can take from their body, then your morals already align with veganism. It is now just a matter of aligning your actions with your morals as well.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Yes, you will have to invest a little bit of time in the very beginning. You will have to make sure you are getting the nutrients you need on a vegan diet. You will have to tweak some of your favorite recipes to make them vegan. You will have to learn how to check for vegan options when going out. But this little bit of planning can be done today. Once it’s done, it’s done, and you can then begin to live in a way that better aligns with your morals. (How to Go Vegan TODAY)
                    <br/><br/>
                    Becoming vegan means that there will be no more animals that are abused and killed for you. It means that you are taking a personal stand against animal abuse. It means that, even though animals have been largely reduced to what we can gain from them, you see them for who they are. It is the least that we can do for the animals.

                <h1>What can you do to help animals on a societal level?</h1>
                <p>
                    You can significantly increase your positive impact on animals and help end animal exploitation on a broader scale by participating in activism and inspiring others to take part in the vegan movement. That's where we come in!
                </p>
                <span id="read-more-societal" style="display: none;">
                    Understand that being vegan is a form of activism. One person does make a difference. With each person that goes vegan, we get closer to the end of animal abuse and exploitation. However, as an activist, you have the opportunity to exponentially increase your impact and bring about a quicker end to animal oppression.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Many people who currently participate in the systems that abuse and exploit animals already agree with veganism. They already value animals as individuals who matter; they just need to be educated on the suffering inflicted on animals and the fact that they would align with their morals as a vegan. Many more people may not fully agree with veganism as of now, but could be persuaded with the right approach. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    The point is, there are many people who are only a step or two away from joining the movement to create a just world for animals, and you could be the one to inspire some of them to take that step or two.
                    <br/><br/>
                    There are many ways to speak up for the animals and help end the systems that oppress them. CAA supports various forms of activism and advocacy, all of which are legal and nonviolent. These include but are not limited to:
                    <br/><br/>

                    <b>Do I need to be vegan to join CAA?</b>
                    <br/>
                    While we strongly urge everyone to be vegan, being vegan is not a requirement to join CAA. Some of our current members are nonvegan, and some of our vegan members were nonvegan when they began doing activism.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The animals need as many voices speaking up for them as possible, including yours, and especially yours. Just like how every animal we advocate for is a unique individual, you are as well. As an activist, you would bring a skillset and perspective that no one else can. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Whether you are best suited for taking part in street outreach, protesting, collecting signatures for a petition, helping with recruitment, posting on social media, or another skill not mentioned, CAA would love to use your help in securing the rights that animals deserve.
